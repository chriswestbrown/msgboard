This project is creating a version of the CS Dept's STEM
password activity that is realistic for a high school teacher
with some technical competency.  The focus is on an infrastructure
that will work with little to no customer service from us.

1. Libraries we rely on: directories CryptoJS and xterm

2. Our code:

   * stemshell.html - webpage for the shell

   * stemshellbase.js - javascript functions

   Feel free to modify this, add new files, etc!

3. This does not require a webserver.  You can pull it up locally
   in your browser (ctrl+o) and navigate to stemshell.html.

4. Major TODO:

   * get things looking nice!  Nice border around terminal, etc.
     - start with focus.  DONE!

   * get MD5 working like it would in a shell.  Mainly this means
     when I backarrow and forward arrow it works, inserting characters
     works properly, "s and 's are handled nicely, can't arrow past the
     current last non-space character, etc.  PROGRESSING!
     NOTE: Insert is still not working!

   * get rytop command working.  It should show the top 20 entries
     of top100.txt  by default.  If run as rytop <n>, should show the
     top <n> entries (up to 100).  DONE!

   * make sure code is organized nicely so I can potentially add more
     stuff!  PROGRESSING!
