The idea here is that modules may exist as separate
git repos.  Info:

    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

git submodule add https://github.com/chriswestbrown/cryptodemo.git


To pull now I need:
git pull
-and- 
git submodule update --init --recursive

Note the assumed layout of a module project is:

foomodule
  \________foomodule

... where the outer 'foomodule' directory contains
things that shouldn't end up as part of the
instructor site, and the inner is the actual directory
that should appear in the instructor site.
