2. ON ARRIVAL
   NOTE: Communicate ahead of time that they have to be prepared to flip between three
         Windows.
	 Zoom window / browser-message-board / browser-cryptotools

   NOTE: In Zoom, use the share/advanced/secondcamera option to show the whiteboard.
         NOTE: *must* start with screenshare, and then switch to sharing second camera,
	       otherwise the meeting controls disappear.
   NOTE: link for crypto demo *must* open in a different tab
   NOTE: Clear about which window to look at when I'm making a point
   NOTE: Take out the function/permutation business.
   a. Post link to message board in chat and have everyone open it and open the cryptoools
      page (linked on message board).  Clarify: *Keep these two tabs open all the time*!!
   a. have everyone create a message board account and post something (small)
      don't tell them why, just say we'll be using it.
      IMPORTANT!!! "You must use the same username as you are using for this zoom session!"
   b. lock message board: mbconf lock
   c. tell brief story of Alice, Bob and Eve
   d. point out that the common case today is something like
      Alice = browser, Bob = bank's webserver, Eve is illicit monitoring program
      IMPORTANT!!! The point of today's activity is to get some insight into how
                   secure browser-webserver communication works "under the hood".
      However, to get there we'll ...
   e. ... go back to Alice and Bob and Eve.  The solution today, as it's been
      for 1000s of years is to *encrypt* the message before sending it.
      Idea: Alice and Bob have a secret "key" that they agree on ahead of time.
            Alice encrypts using the key, Bob decrypts using the key, and (hopefully)
	    Eve can't make sense of what's going on without that key!

3. We're going to start off looking at a simple pencil-and-paper encryption scheme 
   that goes back at least 2,000 years: Caesar Shift Encryption.
   
   a. Here's how it works.  The "key" is a letter of the alphabet (better not choose a,
      as you'll see).  We fill in the table (see your handout) by putting the key
      character under "a" and fill in with successive characters of the alphabet,
      wrapping around back to the beginning after you've used z.  I'm going to start with
      'c', why don't you follow along.
   b. Now let's encrypt "stem". ...
      Now let's decrypt "twngu". ...
   c. Hopefully you all see how this works.  So to save time, instead of using pencil
      and paper I've made this tool for you to use.  (Turn on Caesar Shift in cryptools)
      tell them to switch over to the cryptotools browser tab

   d. I'm going to partner you up (in a minute!), and when I do,
      I want you and your partner to act as Alice and Bob and send each other
      messages that only your partner can read.  But before we can do this, what's
      the problem we face?  Right!  How to agree on a secret key!  In zoom, we have
      person-to-person chat enabled, so for this activity I want you to use that
      this one time to share your secret key (which recall is a letter).  Then go
      to the message board and send your encrypted message.  Note: please
      preface the message with the name of your intended recipient.  That'll make
      it easier to spot.

      NOTE: give the command 'mbpairs drbrown' in the adminshell to get the message
            you'll copy&paste into the message board.

      If you go back to the message board, you'll see that I've paired everyone up.
      I want the first-listed person to choose a letter as your "key" and send a
      private zoom chat message to your partner with the key value.  After that, all
      communication must be done on the message board!



      <Give folks time>

4. Now let's switch from being Alices and Bobs to being Eve!  Is there any way we
   could attack this encryption?

   <lead them through to ... BRUTE FORCE ATTACK!>

5. OK, our encryption scheme failed ... it's susceptible to Brute Force Attack.
   We're going to switch back to being Alices and Bobs and try to figure out
   what we can do to fix this flaw in our system.

   a. We can repair this, but it's going to require changing our viewpoint
      a bit.  Once we decide on a
      particular key, our encryptor looks like this (draw a box with arrows).
      A black box with an input and an output, and everytime we put the same
      character in, we get the same character out.  Does anyone know what we
      call this type of object in math/science/engineering ... a function!

      now, of course, the thing about encryption functions is that they have
      to have inverses ... otherwise you couldn't decrypt!  An invertible
      function on a finite set like the alphabet is equivalent to a
      reordering of the letters ... or, more technically, a permutation.

      So if we ask how many possible encryption functions there are, we are
      asking how many permutations of the 26 letters of the alphabet there
      are.  Does anyone know how to figure that out?  26! show in wolframalpa

      So there are 403291461126605635584000000 (403 septillion) possible
      encryption functions and we're limiting ourselves to just 26?  We need
      a bigger set of possible keys so brute force isn't feasible.

   b. A natural thought is to encrypt twice, that gives two key characters
      for a total not of 26 possible keys but 26^2 possible keys (676).  Big
      improvement.
      <set the chain encryption to visible>
      If you look under the crypto demo tools, you'll see what that looks like.
      Do example.  Show how a character works.  encrypt a short message.
      Then bruteforce decrypt using Caesar shift.  Point out the problem.

   c. Explain the mix function (note, no key!).  And show them shift,mix,shift
      Give them the cipher text below and ask them about brute force!

      key   : wn
      plain : Meet me at the corner of first and main at ten.
      cipher: Uqqb uq ob bhq pvceqc vi iscxb oej uose ob bqe.

   d. If I did four shifts (with mix's in between) we get nearly 500K keys,
      all of which give different encryption functions!  Still a long way
      from 403 spetillion, but certainly enough keys that by hand brute
      force would be ... well it'd take quite a while!

      ### NOTE: two stage (shift, mix, shift) key = lq
      plaintext: Stem is at the root of our modern world.
      plaintext: Kven pk gv vce ummv mb mju nmaeus imura.

6. So let's go back to being Eve. Let's suppose we've received the following
   ciphertext which has been encrypted with four ceasar shifts with mixes
   in between.

According to the most recent SB Nation Reacts survey, 93% of White Sox fans are confident the team is headed in the right direction. That’s up from 80% last week. For any team to find success they need to have faith in their pitching staff. Nearly all of White Sox fans said they are confident in the team’s pitchers. Already this year there have been some exceptional pitching performances around the league. In the time span of less than a week, two no-hitters were thrown. They were the 306th and 307th no-hitters thrown in the league’s history, and the seventh and eighth thrown since the start of the 2019 season. Despite the growing regularity of the outstanding performances, a vast majority of MLB fans believe a pitching a no-hitter is still a historic accomplishment.

NOTE for me: This came from pswd itcs and four stage encrypt and plaintext below:
Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict...



   Brute force is out of the question.  But is there something else we could do?
   <open up free map and letter frequencies in English>
   If you look at the cryptools, we have another tool, which does two things.
   1. we can build the encryption function up piece by piece, and
   2. the tool counts the occurences of letters in the ciphertext and gives
      a graph that shows what percentage of the ciphertext consists of each
      letter.
   <paste message in the ciphertext box ... ask them to do it to ... and click
    the lock icon!>

   Walk through at least a partial descryption using fequency analysis and
   clever guesswork.

7. Now let's return to being Alices and Bobs. Expanding the set of keys (and
   by doing so the set of encryption functions) defeated Brute Force attacks,
   which is great, but frequency ananlysis attacks defeat us.  Can we further
   improve things in order to defeat fequency analysis?  The answer is yes,
   but once again we're going to have to change our viewpoint a bit.
   Instead of using our fancy chain-of-caesar-shifts-and-mixes to encrypt
   plaintext characters, we will use it to *generate keys* which will be used
   to do plain Caesar-shift encryption but with a separate key for each
   character.  Here's how it works ...

   a. <Open up last block>
   b. demo: shift-mix-shift, key "of", plaintext "reader", ciphertext "guhviw".
      Note: even though we have two e's and two r's in the plaintext, each
            ciphertext character is unique.  We can't do frequency analysis.
   c. Give them ciphertext below and key and see if they can figure out decrypt.

       key: crk
 plaintext: m e m e
   counter: a b c d
 keystream: i a l s
ciphertext: u e x w

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

       key: ymr
 plaintext: f o o d
   counter: a b c d
 keystream: b y f j
ciphertext: g m t m 


   d. Show them what the ciphertext for the Pride and Prejudice text looks like and
      how flat the frequencies of letters are.
